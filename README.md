Apple Pie - An iPad word-guessing game made in swift 5

Apple Pie includes a full keyboard to make guessing your words as easy as possible
It also has industry-leading tree and apple graphics
Every time you guess a letter wrong an apple falls off a tree (without animation we don't have budget for that) to showcase how bad you are at this game
